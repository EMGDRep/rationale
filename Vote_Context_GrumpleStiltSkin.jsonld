    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund MLabs Research towards Tooling for Elliptical Curves – GrumpleStiltSkin based on the rationale below\n\nRationale\n\nThis proposal targets one of the foundational gaps in Cardano’s ZK and privacy infrastructure: reusable, composable cryptographic primitives. MLabs proposes to deliver a flexible and open-source elliptic curve toolkit in Plutarch that can support a wide range of use cases beyond current hardcoded implementations. By enabling developers to verify ZK proofs over customizable curves and fields, this work addresses a systemic barrier to ZK app growth.\n\nEMURGO views this as a key technical foundation for advancing privacy, authentication, and smart contract innovation on Cardano. We are confident in MLabs’ capability to deliver meaningful results through their strong track record and deep ecosystem involvement.\n\n\n"
