    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund Gerolamo – Cardano Node in TypeScript based on the rationale provided below.\n\nRationale\nEMURGO supports the strategic vision behind this proposal, which aims to deliver a lightweight Cardano node that runs directly in the browser using TypeScript. This project has the potential to significantly lower technical barriers to entry and expand the developer base by offering a more familiar language and environment. The ability for dApps to operate without relying on centralized backend nodes is closely aligned with Cardano’s core principles of decentralization and accessibility.\n\nWhile we recognize the proposal’s technical ambition and its potential to accelerate broader adoption, we also acknowledge the complexity of delivering a secure, performant node in a browser context. The success of this project will depend on its ability to demonstrate resilience, standards compliance, and real-world usability over time. Nonetheless, we find the innovation and direction promising and worth supporting.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, EMURGO believes that investing in a browser-based light node implementation can be a transformative step for the Cardano ecosystem. We vote YES on this governance action and look forward to seeing how Harmonic Labs advances the decentralization and usability of Cardano through Gerolamo."
