    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO, as a DRep, votes YES for “Cardano 2030: Vision, Mission, Strategy Framework and KPIs”, with rationale outlined below.\n\nRationale\n\nWe appreciate the Intersect Product Committee for putting forward this 2030 Vision, Mission, Strategy Framework, and KPI set through a genuinely community-led process. As Cardano moves deeper into community-led governance, funding and priority-setting benefit from a shared reference point. Without common direction and agreed indicators, treasury decisions risk becoming fragmented.\n\nWe welcome the inclusion of adoption and commercial KPIs such as Total Value Locked, monthly transactions, monthly active users, and protocol revenue, which help anchor governance decisions to real-world usage and long-term sustainability. We recognize that this initial KPI set was developed at a high level to support the current budget cycle and is intentionally flexible rather than final, reinforcing its role as an evolving reference. Clearer articulation over time of how revisions are triggered and reviewed would further strengthen its usefulness.\n\nWhile EMURGO supports this framework as a strong long-term reference, its effectiveness would be enhanced by clearer alignment between long-term KPIs and the Budget Committee’s shorter 12–18 month funding cycles. Greater clarity on how five-year objectives translate into interim targets would help DReps assess proposals more consistently within each budget period and improve treasury accountability. Even with these areas for improvement, EMURGO views this proposal as a constructive and timely foundation for shared strategic alignment. For these reasons, EMURGO votes YES."
