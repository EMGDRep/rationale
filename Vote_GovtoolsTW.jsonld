    "comment": "Summary:\n\nEMURGO as DRep abstains on the governance action to fund Cardano GovTool – Treasury Withdrawal for 12 months of active maintenance and development, following the previously approved Budget Info Action for ₳1.15M. \n\nRationale:\n\nEMURGO recognizes that GovTool has made clear progress since the previous Info Action, particularly in technical performance and delivery structure. The proposal presents a stronger framework for accountability and transparency under Intersect’s oversight.\n\nHowever, given the ongoing adjustments in Cardano’s governance landscape and the need to observe how these operational improvements perform over time, EMURGO believes a neutral position is most appropriate. Abstaining reflects continued support for the process and the principle of community-driven governance, while allowing room for further evaluation of execution consistency in the months ahead.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEMURGO as DRep abstains, acknowledging GovTool’s significance and progress, while maintaining a balanced and observant stance in alignment with EMURGO’s responsibility to support both accountability and long-term ecosystem stability."
