By tokenizing home equity, Haus unlocks liquidity for homeowners while offering new, stable investment opportunities for users. The project is backed by an experienced team, proven traction, and a clear roadmap, including legal and DeFi integration. EMURGO also appreciates the project’s open-source approach and its commitment to donating back to the treasury, signaling long-term alignment with Cardano’s sustainability goals. We see this as a powerful driver of ecosystem growth and RWA adoption on Cardano."
