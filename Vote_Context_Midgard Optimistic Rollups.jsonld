    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action for Midgard – Optimistic Rollups, based on the rationale below.\n\nRationale\nMidgard presents a bold, deeply Cardano-native approach to rollups, directly leveraging the strengths of the eUTxO model to enable permissionless, non-custodial, and censorship-resistant L2s. Unlike many Ethereum-based alternatives, Midgard’s architecture allows for simplified, single-party fraud proofs and seamless fee alignment with L1 via ADA-based transactions.\n\nIts tokenless design, L1-fee contribution model, and support for decentralized operators make it a potential cornerstone for scalable Cardano dApps. The proposal is highly technical but aligns with the core goals of L2 expansion, and the team at Anastasia Labs has a proven open-source track record.\n\nConclusion\nGiven the innovation, alignment with Cardano’s architecture, and the potential for long-term L1 economic value, EMURGO supports this proposal and votes Yes."
