    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as a DRep votes Yes on the info governance action \n\nRationale\n\nAt EMURGO, we’ve been closely following the development of Amaru and have great confidence in PRAGMA and its members as leading experts in the field. Their deep understanding of the complexities involved in building a full working Cardano node, combined with their extensive experience in the ecosystem, positions them as the ideal team to tackle the challenges of developing an alternative node implementation. \n\nThe existing Cardano node implementation leaves developers with little flexibility, and this is where Amaru’s alternative node can make a big difference. We see the introduction of an alternative node as critical for Cardano’s growth. By reducing reliance on a single node implementation, Amaru will not only increase security but also provide more options for developers. This diversity is essential for attracting new projects and talent, especially those who have been hesitant to join Cardano due to the Haskell-based limitations.\n\nAmaru also aligns perfectly with our vision of decentralizing Cardano’s infrastructure. By offering a competitive alternative, we will improve the flexibility and resilience of the entire ecosystem.\n"
