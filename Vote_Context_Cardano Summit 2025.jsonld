The 2025 proposal builds on that momentum with a multi-regional model co-executed by community-aligned partners.\n\nEMURGO is confident in the Cardano Foundation’s track record and its ability to deliver world-class events. This year, we are honored to contribute as a regional co-host for the India Summit and will continue to support initiatives that expand Cardano’s adoption across global hubs."
