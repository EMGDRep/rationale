    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as DRep votes to ABSTAIN on the governance action to fund Cardano in Oceania: A community-led strategic plan for investing in growth.\n\nRationale\n\nWe deeply appreciate the effort and intention behind this proposal, which is well-prepared, transparent, and aligned with Cardano’s values. Regional initiatives like this are important in strengthening Cardano’s global presence, and we value the proposer’s commitment to community building and adoption in Oceania.\n\nAt the same time, EMURGO is currently advancing a unified global marketing initiative aimed at creating consistent and cohesive branding for Cardano worldwide. We believe the activities described in this proposal, such as events, storytelling, and community engagement, would thrive as part of that unified effort. For this reason, we highly recommend that the proposer connect with the GMC of Intersect to explore opportunities for consolidation and integration into the unified marketing plan for 2026.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy abstaining, EMURGO acknowledges the strong value of this initiative and encourages closer collaboration with the broader marketing framework to maximize impact and ensure a globally unified Cardano presence.\n"
