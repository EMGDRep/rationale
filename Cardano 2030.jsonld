    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as DRep votes to ABSTAIN on the governance action titled Cardano 2030 Vision & Strategy.\n\nRationale\n\nEMURGO fully supports the importance of establishing a clear, community-backed long-term vision and strategy for Cardano. However, based on information from the Product Committee of Intersect, an official governance action covering this topic is already scheduled to be released at the end of October. Voting on the current version would lead to overlapping actions and potentially incomplete inputs being considered ahead of the full proposal. \n\nConclusion\n\nBy abstaining now, EMURGO signals support for the process, but will provide its full position once the official governance action is published to ensure clarity, completeness, and alignment with community expectations."
