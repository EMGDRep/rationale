Its robust infrastructure, clear deliverables, and strong team give us confidence in its ability to continue delivering real-time insights and developer-facing tools. While Cardano has several explorers, the platform’s proven utility and community presence justify further investment. Supporting this proposal ensures ongoing reliability and usability for developers, SPOs, and end users alike.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, EMURGO supports this proposal due to its track record, high usage, and relevance to ecosystem infrastructure, especially for developer and user transparency needs."
