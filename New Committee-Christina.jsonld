    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO, as a DRep, votes NO on the governance action to add an additional Constitutional Committee member, with rationale below.\n\nRationale\n\nWhile we acknowledge the qualifications of the proposed individual, Christina Gianelloni, and the good intentions behind the proposal, the Intersect snap election was explicitly conducted to elect one Constitutional Committee member, and Cardano Curia was the clear winner of that process. Adding the runner-up cannot be considered an outcome of that election.\n\nThe Cardano Constitution does not clearly permit or prohibit expanding the committee beyond replacing a resigning member, placing this proposal in a procedurally ambiguous area. Expanding the committee from seven to eight members also carries concrete implications, including changes to decision thresholds and potential additional compensation costs, which should not be introduced without a clear basis. \n\nAs DReps, we consider it reasonable to vote based on constitutional interpretation to avoid setting an unclear precedent. For these reasons, EMURGO votes NO."
