    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as a DRep votes YES to the info action titled “Name Protocol Version 11 hard fork - van Rossem,” with rationale outlined below.\n\nRationale\nCardano has an established convention of assigning names to hard forks that reflect important moments and contributors in the network’s history. This proposal follows that convention by recognizing a community member whose work had a tangible impact on Cardano’s governance framework.\n\nMax van Rossem was actively involved in governance design and coordination during the network’s transition toward on-chain governance. His contributions across constitutional work, governance working groups, and the Constitutional Committee election process supported the development of more structured and representative governance mechanisms.\n\nNaming the next hard fork in his memory serves a commemorative purpose and aligns with prior ecosystem practice. For these reasons, EMURGO votes yes."
