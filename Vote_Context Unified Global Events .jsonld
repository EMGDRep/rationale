Competing ecosystems have made significant gains through consistent branding and developer outreach via flagship events.\n\nThis proposal as a standalone or as complementary of the other similar proposals offers a focused approach to positioning Cardano as a serious Layer 1 contender by aligning messaging, strengthening branding, and creating touchpoints across developer, enterprise, and policymaker communities. Given the scale of the opportunity and the need to reduce brand fragmentation, we proudly support this initiative and vote yes."
