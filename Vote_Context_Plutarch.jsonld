    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as a DRep votes YES on this governance action based on the rationale below.\n\nRationale\nPlutarch plays a vital role in enabling performant, low-level smart contract development across the Cardano ecosystem. As an embedded Haskell-based DSL, it is foundational for advanced dApp developers, allowing for more efficient scripting and optimized transaction costs. Its wide adoption—by projects like Genius Yield, AADA, Liqwid, and many more—proves its importance. This proposal seeks funding for ongoing maintenance and enhancement, ensuring that Plutarch remains up-to-date with Cardano’s evolving protocol, especially ahead of upcoming hardforks. The technical scope is clear, and the team at MLabs has a proven track record in maintaining complex infrastructure tools.\n\nIn conclusion, EMURGO supports continued investment in Plutarch to ensure the resilience and reliability of Cardano’s smart contract ecosystem."
