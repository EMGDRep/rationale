    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to support the Cardano Product Committee: Community-driven 2030 Cardano Vision and 2026 roadmap insights collection via workshops and structured product research.\n\nRationale\nAs Cardano matures beyond its founder-defined roadmap, creating a long-term vision driven by real user needs and grounded market insights becomes not only valuable but crucial. This proposal introduces the systematic approach to ecosystem-wide product research and strategic direction setting, anchored in active community engagement across global regions.\n\nIntersect’s Product Committee is well-positioned to lead this effort, given their collaborative structure, prior outputs, and integration with other governance and technical bodies. With a relatively modest budget, the proposal offers high strategic return by establishing reusable research frameworks, validating use cases, and ensuring community alignment for the 2030 vision. EMURGO supports this initiative as a necessary step to sharpen Cardano’s strategic focus and unlock more targeted growth."
