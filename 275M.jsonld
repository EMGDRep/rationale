    "comment": "Rationale:\n\nThis budget info action represents a constitutionally required checkpoint under Cardano Constitution, and its passage is a prerequisite for any treasury withdrawal. As such, EMURGO supports this budget info action not only for its content but also for upholding the governance framework that ensures decentralized, accountable, and transparent use of the Cardano Treasury.\n\nThe budget info action reflects months of collaborative effort across the Cardano community. It includes structured, community-driven submissions that span core infrastructure, governance tooling, open-source development, marketing initiatives and critical ecosystem services. We recognize the collective diligence demonstrated through multiple public AMAs, forums, and voting platforms, culminating in proposals that have met the quality standards expected of this process.\n\nEMURGO acknowledges Intersect’s role as the designated Administrator, as well as the adoption of oversight mechanisms, including smart contract-based fund flows and audit requirements. These safeguard measures strengthen our confidence in the transparency and execution of the budget.\n\nUltimately, we believe this budget lays a solid foundation for Cardano’s next phase of growth. EMURGO supports this Info Action as a necessary and constructive step toward sustainable treasury allocation and the long-term vision of the Cardano blockchain."
