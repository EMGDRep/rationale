    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO DRep votes YES on the Treasury Withdrawal proposal titled “₳5M Loan for Cardano’s Global Listing Expansion – Powered by SNEK.”\n\nRationale\n\nAs a follow-up to our prior YES vote on the Budget Info Action for this same initiative, EMURGO reaffirms its support for this proposal, recognizing it as a milestone in advancing Cardano’s governance and financial maturity. By adopting a loan-based funding structure, the proposal strengthens fiscal responsibility within Treasury operations, ensuring that ecosystem capital is both utilized productively and replenished over time.\n\nThe Snek Foundation has already demonstrated strong operational capability by independently securing Tier 1 listings, historic achievements for Cardano-native assets. Their consistent delivery record and readiness to engage in structured repayments underscore both competence and commitment.\nAdditionally, with EMURGO CEO Phillip Pon serving on the Board of Advisors, this proposal offers a valuable opportunity to contribute to oversight and strategic alignment, ensuring that execution remains accountable, transparent, and aligned with Cardano’s broader market growth objectives.\n\nConclusion\n\nEMURGO supports this governance action as a natural progression of our earlier endorsement under the BIA. The proposal not only amplifies Cardano’s global visibility but also pioneers a sustainable funding model for the ecosystem. We encourage the Snek team to maintain continued transparency and detailed performance reporting throughout its implementation."
