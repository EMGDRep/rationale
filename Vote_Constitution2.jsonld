    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as DRep votes to ABSTAIN on the governance action to ratify the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution v2.0.\n\nRationale\n\nWe appreciate the effort to improve the Constitution through amendment, especially the attempt to clarify definitions and introduce additional oversight standards. These updates show a genuine commitment to strengthening governance and moving the ecosystem forward. \n\nAt the same time, we remain concerned with both the process and content. The proposal moved on-chain while significant feedback was still emerging, showing that broader consensus has not yet been reached. On substance, removing the budget Info Action weakens the link between treasury withdrawals and long-term priorities. In addition, changes to the auto-abstain safeguard create ambiguity around the influence of treasury funds on governance outcomes.\n\nConclusion\nGiven these open concerns and the need for wider deliberation, EMURGO chooses to abstain at this stage. This decision reflects a call for further discussion and refinement before bringing forward such an important revision."
