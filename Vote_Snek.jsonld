    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as DRep votes NO on the governance action to fund the Cardano Global Listing Expansion initiative by the Snek Foundation.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Snek team has demonstrated exceptional execution capability, securing Tier 1 listings through self-funding and driving unmatched adoption for a Cardano native token. These achievements are commendable and recognized. However, EMURGO maintains a principle that treasury allocations for exchange listings should be tied to clear, measurable benefits for the broader ecosystem, either through collective infrastructure, demonstrable long-term ROI, or repayment to the Treasury. In its current form, this proposal focuses on a single-token listing without such mechanisms in place, creating a precedent that may be difficult to sustain.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe invite the Snek team to submit a revised version that: Provides a corrected, transparent budget\n\nEstablishes either a repayment model or a shared infrastructure plan\n\nAligns deliverables with measurable ecosystem-wide outcomes\n\nWith such adjustments, EMURGO would be open to reassessing support.\n"
