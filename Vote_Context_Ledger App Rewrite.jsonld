    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to support the Ledger App Rewrite proposal.\n\nRationale\nLedger remains a critical access point for ADA holders worldwide, especially those prioritizing hardware wallet security. This proposal addresses long-standing UX inconsistencies within the Cardano Ledger app, aligning it with modern standards and streamlining the user journey.\n\nWe believe that Vacuumlabs is well-positioned to carry out this work. Combined with their separate proposal on long-term hardware wallet maintenance, this rewrite ensures both compatibility with Ledgerâ€™s testing suite and future device updates. EMURGO supports this effort as a meaningful improvement to the Cardano user experience and ecosystem reliability and therefore has voted Yes for this propposal."
