    "comment": "Rationale\n\nWe are highly supportive of ensuring that Constitutional Committee members receive sustainable compensation for their meaningful contributions. Their constitutional oversight is central to Cardano’s governance, and the Constitution itself anticipates that key governance roles should be fairly and appropriately compensated.\n\nAt the Cardano Summit in Berlin, EMURGO and Intersect organized a brief session with DReps, CC members, stake pool operators, and other governance enthusiasts to gather broader feedback. It became apparent that there is a gap in how the proposer and the DReps interpret the clarity of this Budget Info action. \n\nSome DReps noted that the 1,000,000 ADA figure remains unclear, or that they are unsure where to find the most up-to-date supporting materials, while the proposer has provided certain rationales on X and other platforms.\n\nThis difference in perception highlights the need for a shared space where all relevant information can be presented transparently and discussed before moving forward. We acknowledge the materials and explanations provided by current CC members, but a common forum would help refine assumptions and strengthen collective understanding of the proposed compensation model.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur abstention reflects the need for additional clarity and alignment. We remain highly supportive of establishing sustainable compensation for the Constitutional Committee; however, this proposal requires clearer justification and stronger consensus across stakeholders before we can fully endorse it."
