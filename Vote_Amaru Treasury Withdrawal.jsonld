    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO as a DRep votes Yes on Amaru Treasury Withdrawal governance action.\n\nRationale\n\nEMURGO supports this treasury withdrawal, recognizing it as a groundbreaking milestone for funding an alternative node implementation through a transparent and auditable process. We have unwavering confidence in PRAGMA’s technical expertise and their dedication to building a more flexible and resilient Cardano ecosystem. By diversifying node implementations beyond the current Haskell-based version, Amaru directly addresses long-standing challenges for developers and creates new opportunities for innovation, security, and growth within the community.\n\nThis proposal stands out for its strong commitment to financial transparency and accountability. We appreciate the inclusion of an independent auditor, whose oversight will ensure responsible management of funds. The project team has already taken clear, proactive steps to facilitate future audits for all transactions executed from the smart contracts.\n\nWe also find the use of intermediary smart contracts before any disbursement to beneficiaries particularly reassuring. This approach enforces robust on-chain controls: funds held in the contract cannot be delegated to any SPO and must be delegated to an auto-abstain DRep. This not only prevents misuse, but also upholds Cardano’s core values of transparency and responsible treasury management.\n\nFinally, we view the proposed budget as both reasonable and efficient, demonstrating careful planning and a deep understanding of the requirements for such a pivotal initiative. As the first governance action of its kind, EMURGO is proud to support this project and set a positive precedent for future on-chain funding within Cardano.\n\nWe’re confident to cast a YES vote and look forward to seeing Amaru strengthen Cardano with greater diversity and resilience.\n"
