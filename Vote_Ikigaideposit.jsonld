    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO DRep votes YES on the Budget Info Action to reimburse 100,000 ADA related to the “Cardanoの生きがい (Ikigai)” Info Action.\n\nRationale\n\nWe support reimbursing the original 100,000 ADA deposit because it was lost due to a protocol bug during the very early phase of on-chain governance, not due to user misconduct. Restoring the deposit aligns with community sentiment at the time and reflects fairness toward early governance participants.\n\nHowever, the proposal does not clearly establish who is submitting this reimbursement request, what their relationship is to the original Ikigai author, nor whether the original author explicitly wishes to have the deposit returned. We would like to see explicit confirmation from the original proposer, or a clear proof of continuity before any withdrawal is executed.\n\nThe community has discussed Ikigai reimbursement for a long time, yet this request (especially the extra 3,000 ADA) is only coming now, raising concern that the longer someone waits, the more “missed opportunities” they can claim, potentially incentivizing strategic delays in future cases. While we will still vote YES on the proposal as submitted, our expectation for similar cases in the future is clearer identification of the claimant and a concrete, data-based justification for any amount that exceeds the original deposit."
