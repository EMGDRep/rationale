    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund zkFold ZK Rollup.\nRationale\nWe believe that ZK rollups represent a key piece of Cardano’s long-term scalability roadmap. zkFold’s approach to compressing smart contract transactions into a single L1 interaction aligns well with the goals of reducing congestion, lowering fees, and supporting high-performance dApps.\nWith the team already building a prototype independently, this proposal is a timely opportunity to back an early mover in ZK infrastructure for Cardano. While technical execution in this domain carries complexity, the team’s experience in Rust, Haskell, and ZK proofs provides a credible foundation. EMURGO supports this proposal as part of Cardano’s broader commitment to competitive L2 innovation."
