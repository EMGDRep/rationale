    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to support A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect.\n\nRationale\nEMURGO acknowledges Intersect’s expanding role in coordinating Cardano’s governance and development activities, including managing roadmap processes, supporting elected committees, and maintaining community infrastructure. These responsibilities are essential as the network transitions toward more decentralized execution.\n\nWhile the proposal presents a significant cost increase from the previous cycle, the capped allocation, quarterly disbursement, and commitment to return unused funds provide reasonable guardrails. However, the scale and ambition of the activities outlined make it especially important for the DReps and broader community to monitor delivery closely and ensure the intended value is realized.\n\nOur support reflects recognition of the need for stable coordination infrastructure at this stage of Cardano’s evolution, while also emphasizing the importance of accountability and execution quality."
