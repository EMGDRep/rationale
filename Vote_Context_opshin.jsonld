    "comment": "Summary\nEMURGO as DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund OpShin - Python Smart Contracts for Cardano, based on the rationale provided below.\n\nRationale\nEMURGO believes OpShin represents a crucial gateway for expanding smart contract development on Cardano by lowering technical entry barriers. Unlike other contract languages in the ecosystem that require specialized functional programming skills, OpShin leverages Python, one of the most widely adopted languages globally to make Cardano development far more accessible and familiar to a broader developer base.\n\nThe toolchain is already functional, open source, and has a history of steady development supported by multiple Catalyst grants. Its strict typing, compilation efficiency, and integration with modern Python tooling reflect a thoughtful and production-ready approach. Given the ongoing need to attract new talent and simplify onboarding in Cardano's smart contract space, we find this initiative highly strategic and cost-effective.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, EMURGO supports funding OpShin as an impactful, developer-friendly toolchain that can drive adoption, ecosystem growth, and accessibility."
